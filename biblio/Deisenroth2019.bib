abstract = {Machine learning is the latest in a long line of attempts to distill human knowledge and reasoning into a form that is suitable for constructing ma- chines and engineering automated systems. As machine learning becomes more ubiquitous and its software packages become easier to use, it is nat- ural and desirable that the low-level technical details are abstracted away and hidden from the practitioner. However, this brings with it the danger that a practitioner becomes unaware of the design decisions and, hence, the limits of machine learning algorithms. The enthusiastic practitioner who is interested to learn more about the magic behind successful machine learning algorithms currently faces a daunting set of pre-requisite knowledge: Programming languages and data analysis tools Large-scale computation and the associated frameworks Mathematics and statistics and how machine learning builds on it},
