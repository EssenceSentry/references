abstract = {We use the concept of laminar flow, as opposed to turbulent flow, as a metaphor for the decomposition of well-behaved purely functional data-flow programs into largely independent parts, necessitated by aspects with different execution constraints. In the context of the total functional data-flow language Sig, we identify three distinct but methodologically related implementation challenges, namely multirate scheduling, declarative initialization, and conditional execution, and demonstrate how they can be solved orthogonally, by decomposition using the standard program transformation technique, slicing.},
