abstract = {Iterative methods for the solution of nonlinear systems of equations such as Newton's method are usually based on local linearizations; iterative procedures which locally use quadratic approximations of the functions whose zero is to be determined are studied. Our approach yields fourth order iterative methods which are more efficient than their classical counterparts such as Chebyshev's and Halley's method. Iterative methods of the kind discussed here are from a practical point of view certainly not as important as Newton-like methods; they may be appropriate, however, for special types of nonlinear problems. {\textcopyright}1986.},
