abstract = {The past few years has witnessed an increasing in both academic and industry to integrate the expert systems with database management systems (DBMS) technologies to develop more intelligent applications. This integration gives the expert systems the power of database management features and ability to access large volume of information in real time. The strength of the DBMS is storing and manipulating large quantities of data. Similarly, expert systems benefits from having capabilities to infer new data (or facts) from the existing database, as well as, easily access a large quantities of data. This data can be used to produces expert advice, ranging from helpful suggestions to outright decisions. Understanding the limitations of the DBMS and expert systems helps to explain the need for their integration. In this paper we design and implementing a visual environment for building and integrating expert systems with various DBMS. It consists of two independent but complementary subsystems. The first subsystem, knowledge base builder (KBB), is used to build the knowledge base for an expert system from various DBMS, such as, Oracle, MS-SQL Server, MS-Access, â‹¯ etc. The second subsystem, visual expert system builder (VESB), is used to generate a complete expert system in PROLOG language, and integrate it with the knowledge base that generated by the KBB subsystem. Finally, the main characteristics of the system are: efficiency, simplicity of use, and high degree of portability, which make it an ideal choice for generating various types of expert systems.},
