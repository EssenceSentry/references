abstract = {Standard Upper Ontology Knowledge Interchange Format (SUO-KIF) is a language designed for use in the authoring and interchange of knowledge. SUO-KIF has declarative semantics. It is possible to understand the meaning of expressions in the language without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions. In this way, KIF differs from other languages that are based on specific interpreters, such as Emycin and Prolog. SUO-KIF is also logically comprehensive â€“ at its most general, it provides for the expression of arbitrary logical sentences. In this way, it differs from relational database languages (like SQL) and logic programming languages (like Prolog). SUOKIF is intended primarily a first-order language, which is a good compromise between the computational demands of reasoning and richness of representation. In later sections of this document we describe ways in which SUO-KIF is made as expressive as possible without becoming higher-order.},
