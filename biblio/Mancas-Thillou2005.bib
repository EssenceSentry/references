abstract = {We propose a super-resolution technique specifically aimed at enhancing low-resolution text images from handheld devices. The Teager filter, a quadratic unsharp masking filter, is used to highlight high frequencies which are then combined with the warped and interpolated image sequence following motion estimation using Taylor series decomposition. Comparative performance evaluation is presented in the form of OCR results of the super-resolution output.},
