abstract = {-Crime, as a long-term global problem, has been showing the complex interactions with space, time and environments. Extracting effective features to reveal such entangled relationships to predict where and when crimes will occur, is becoming a hot topic and also a bottleneck for researchers. We, therefore, proposed a novel Spatiotemporal Crime Network (STCN), in an attempt to apply deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatically crime-referenced feature extraction. This model can forecast the crime risk of each region in the urban area for the next day from the retrospective volume of high-dimension data. We evaluated the STCN using felony and 311 datasets in New York City from 2010 to 2015. The results showed STCN achieved 88{\%} and 92{\%} on F1 and AUC respectively, confirming the performances of STCN exceeded those of four baselines. Finally, the predicted results was visualized to help people understanding its linking with the ground truth.},
