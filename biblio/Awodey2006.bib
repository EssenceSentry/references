abstract = {This book is a text and reference book on Category Theory, a branch of abstract algebra. The book contains clear definitions of the essential concepts, which are illuminated with numerous accessible examples. It provides full proofs of all the important propositions and theorems, and aims to make the basic ideas, theorems, and methods of Category Theory understandable. Although it assumes few mathematical pre-requisites, the standard of mathematical rigour is not compromised. The material covered includes the standard core of categories; functors; natural transformations; equivalence; limits and colimits; functor categories; representables; Yoneda's lemma; adjoints; and monads. An extra topic of cartesian closed categories and the lambda-calculus is also provided.},
