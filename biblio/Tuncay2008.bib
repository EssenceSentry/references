abstract = {The time evolution of Earth with her cities, languages and countries is considered in terms of the multiplicative noise1 and the fragmentation processes, where the related families, size distributions, lifetimes, bilinguals, etc. are studied. Earlier we treated the cities and the languages differently (and as connected; languages split since cities split, etc.). Hence, two distributions are obtained in the same computation at the same time. The same approach is followed here and ParetoZipf law for the distribution of the cities, log-normal for the languages, decreasing exponential for the city families (countries) in the rank order over population, and power law -2 for the language families over the number of languages in rank order are obtained theoretically in this combination for the first time (up to our knowledge) in the literature; all of which are in good agreement with the present empirical data. {\textcopyright}2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.},
