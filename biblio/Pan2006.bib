abstract = {We present a novel hybrid scheme called “hyper-resolution” that integrates image probability-filtering-based interpolation and improved Poisson maximum a posteriori (MAP) super-resolution to respectively enhance high spatial and spatial-frequency res- olutions ofa single down-sampled image. A new approach to interpolation is proposed for simultaneous image interpolation and smoothing by exploiting the probability filter coupled with a pyramidal decomposition and the Poisson MAP super-resolution is improved with the techniques of edge maps and pseudo-blurring. Simulation results demonstrate that this hyper-resolution scheme substantially improves the quality of a single gray-level, color, or noisy image, respectively.},
