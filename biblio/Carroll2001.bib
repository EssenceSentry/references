abstract = {General relativity (GR) is the most beautiful physical theory ever invented. Nevertheless, it has a reputation of being extremely difficult, primarily for two reasons: tensors are ev- erywhere, and spacetime is curved. These two facts force GR people to use a different language than everyone else, which makes the theory somewhat inaccessible. Nevertheless, it is possible to grasp the basics of the theory, even if you're not Einstein (and who is?).},
