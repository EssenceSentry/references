abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Education has not changed from the beginning of recorded history. The problem is that focus has been on schools and teachers and not students. Here is a simple thought experiment with two conditions: 1) 50 teachers are assigned by their teaching quality to randomly composed classes of 20 students, 2) 50 classes of 20 each are composed by selecting the most able students to fill each class in order and teachers are assigned randomly to classes. In condition 1, teaching ability of each teacher and in condition 2, mean ability level of students in each class is correlated with average gain over the course of instruction. Educational gain will be best predicted by student abilities (up to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}= 0.95) and much less by teachers' skill (up to {\textless}italic{\textgreater}r{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}= 0.32). I argue that seemingly immutable education will not change until we fully understand students and particularly human intelligence. Over the last 50 years in developed countries, evidence has accumulated that only about 10{\%} of school achievement can be attributed to schools and teachers while the remaining 90{\%} is due to characteristics associated with students. Teachers account for from 1{\%} to 7{\%} of total variance at every level of education. For students, intelligence accounts for much of the 90{\%} of variance associated with learning gains. This evidence is reviewed. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
