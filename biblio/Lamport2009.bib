abstract = {Summary form only given. Algorithms are different from programs and should not be described with programming languages. For example, algorithms are usually best described in terms of mathematical objects like sets and graphs instead of the primitive objects like bytes and integers provided by programming languages. +CAL is an algorithm language based on TLA+. A +CAL algorithm is translated to a TLA+ specification that can then be checked with the TLC model checker},
