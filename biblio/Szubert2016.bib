abstract = {In recent years, a number of methods have been
proposed that attempt to improve the performance of
genetic programming by exploiting information about
program semantics. One of the most important
developments in this area is semantic backpropagation.
The key idea of this method is to decompose a program
into two parts: a sub program and a context, and
calculate the desired semantics of the subprogram that
would make the entire program correct, assuming that
the context remains unchanged. In this paper we
introduce Forward Propagation Mutation, a novel
operator that relies on the opposite assumption.
instead of preserving the context, it retains the
subprogram and attempts to place it in the semantically
right context. We empirically compare the performance
of semantic backpropagation and forward propagation
operators on a set of symbolic regression benchmarks.
The experimental results demonstrate that semantic
forward propagation produces smaller programs that
achieve significantly higher generalization
performance.},
