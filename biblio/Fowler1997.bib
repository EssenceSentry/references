abstract = {Written for those already grounded in object-oriented analysis and design, this concise overview introduces you to UML, highlighting the key elements of its notation, semantics, and processes. Included is a brief explanation of UML's history, development, and rationale, as well as discussions on how UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. In addition, the book profiles various modeling techniques associated with UML - use cases, CRC cards, design by contract, dynamic classification, interfaces, and abstract classes - along with concise descriptions of notation and semantics and numerous insightful tips for effective use based on the authors' experience. In addition, the authors offer the first look at the emerging Objectory Software Development Process derived from the methodologies of Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh. To give you a feel for the UML in action, the book includes a Java programming example that outlines the implementation of a UML-based design. You will come away with an excellent understanding of UML essentials, insight into how UML functions within the software development process, and a firm foundation upon which to expand and build your knowledge of the Unified Modeling Language.
