abstract = {Edge-Valued Binary-Decision Diagrams (EVBDD's) are directed{\$}\backslash{\$}nacyclic graphs that can represent and manipulate integer functions as{\$}\backslash{\$}neffectively as Ordered Binary-Decision Diagrams OBDD's) do for Boolean{\$}\backslash{\$}nfunctions. They have been used in logic verification for showing the{\$}\backslash{\$}nequivalence between Boolean functions and arithmetic functions. In this{\$}\backslash{\$}npaper, we present EVBDD-based algorithms for solving integer linear{\$}\backslash{\$}nprograms, computing spectral coefficients of Boolean functions, and{\$}\backslash{\$}nperforming function decomposition. These algorithms have been{\$}\backslash{\$}nimplemented in C under the SIS environment and experimental results are{\$}\backslash{\$}nprovided},
