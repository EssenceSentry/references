abstract = {The machine learning community has recently shown a lot of inter-est in practical probabilistic programming systems that target the problem of Bayesian inference. Such systems come in different forms, but they all express probabilistic models as computational processes using syntax resembling programming languages. In the functional programming community monads are known to offer a convenient and elegant abstraction for programming with probabil-ity distributions, but their use is often limited to very simple in-ference problems. We show that it is possible to use the monad abstraction to construct probabilistic models for machine learning, while still offering good performance of inference in challenging models. We use a GADT as an underlying representation of a prob-ability distribution and apply Sequential Monte Carlo-based meth-ods to achieve efficient inference. We define a formal semantics via measure theory. We demonstrate a clean and elegant implementa-tion that achieves performance comparable with Anglican, a state-of-the-art probabilistic programming system.},
