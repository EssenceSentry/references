abstract = {This book is intended as an introduction to cryptography for pro- grammers of any skill level. It's a continuation of a talk of the same name, which was given by the author at PyCon 2013. The structure of this book is very similar: it starts with very simple primitives, and gradually introduces new ones, demonstrating why they're necessary. Eventually, all of this is put together into complete, practical cryptosystems, such as TLS, GPG and OTR.},
