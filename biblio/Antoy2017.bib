abstract = {This book is about programming in Curry, a general-purpose declarative programming lan- guage that integrates functional with logic programming. Curry seamlessly combines the key features of functional programming (nested expressions, lazy evaluation, higher-order functions), logic programming (logical variables, partial data structures, built-in search), and concurrent programming (concurrent evaluation of constraints with synchronization on logical variables).},
