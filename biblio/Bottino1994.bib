abstract = {The interest in the use of Logic Programming in education stems from the great enthusiasm for Prolog that arose in the late seventies. However, Prolog is neither the purest Logic Programming language nor the easiest language for novices to come to terms with-but the opportunity to introduce very powerful ideas by teaching students to program in Prolog has been seized by many teachers at all levels of education. The continued success of Logic Programming depends in part on improved support for learning Prolog. Therefore, we concentrate here on issues connected with the development of a more integrated and complete view of learning and teaching Prolog.},
