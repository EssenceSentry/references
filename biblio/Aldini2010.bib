abstract = {In the field of formalmethods in computer science, concurrency theory is receiving a constantly increasing interest. This is especially true for process algebra. Although it had been originally conceived as a means for reasoning about the semantics of con- current programs, process algebraic formalisms like CCS, CSP, ACP, {\$}\pi{\$}-calculus, and their extensions were soon used also for comprehending functional and nonfunctional aspects of the behavior of communicating concurrent systems.},
