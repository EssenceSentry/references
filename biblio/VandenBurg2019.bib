abstract = {Data scientists spend the majority of their time on preparing data for analysis. One of the first steps in this preparation phase is to load the data from the raw storage format. Comma-separated value (CSV) files are a popular format for tabular data due to their simplicity and ostensible ease of use. However, formatting standards for CSV files are not followed consistently, so each file requires manual inspection and potentially repair before the data can be loaded, an enormous waste of human effort for a task that should be one of the simplest parts of data science. The first and most essential step in retrieving data from CSV files is deciding on the dialect of the file, such as the cell delimiter and quote character. Existing dialect detection approaches are few and non-robust. In this paper, we propose a dialect detection method based on a novel measure of data consistency of parsed data files. Our method achieves 97{\%} overall accuracy on a large corpus of real-world CSV files and improves the accuracy on messy CSV files by almost 22{\%} compared to existing approaches, including those in the Python standard library. Our measure of data consistency is not specific to the data parsing problem, and has potential for more general applicability.},
