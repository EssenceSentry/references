abstract = {Among the several misunderstandings about Program Synthesis (PS), we particularly examine the one relative to Logic Programming alleged to have solved this problem. We exem- pliâ‚¬{\~{}} how it is indeed quite possible to write down specifications in PROLOG. Nevertheless, well-known theoretical reasons limit this possibility, and we provide a detailed analysis of the practi- cal reasons why a formal specification may be hard to program in PROLOG. All that contributes to the clarification of the exact role of PS in AI and in Software Engineering, and its possible application to software certification.},
