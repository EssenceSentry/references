abstract = {In 1989 when functional programming was still considered a niche topic, Hughes wrote a visionary paper arguing convincingly " why functional programming matters " . More than two decades have pas-sed. Has functional programming really mattered? Our answer is a resounding " Yes! " . Functional programming is now at the forefront of a new generation of programming technologies, and enjoying incre-asing popularity and influence. In this paper, we review the impact of functional programming, focusing on how it has changed the way we may construct programs, the way we may verify programs, and fundamentally the way we may think about programs.},
