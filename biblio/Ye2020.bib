abstract = {Typesetting software like LATEX has accelerated scientific communication by beautifully typesetting plain- text notation, but no equivalent exists for making diagrams. We are therefore building a system called PENROSE, which allows people to create beautiful diagrams by just typing mathematical notation in plain text. Penrose aims to enable non-experts to create and explore high-quality diagrams, providing deeper insight into challenging technical concepts. Figure 1 illustrates how abstract statements about concepts in linear algebra may be automatically converted into a diagram. (I will use linear algebra as a running example, but PENROSE is designed to be extensible to any mathematical domain.) PENROSE is a highly interdisciplinary project that draws on insights from the areas of programming languages, computer graphics, and systems. The core challenge in designing the PENROSE languages is to provide customizable visual representations for concept-level expressions in an extensible collection of domains. The core challenge in designing the the numerical solver is to quickly create diagrams with user-defined shapes, objectives, and constraints so these diagrams are both beautiful and meaningful. And the core challenge of building the whole system is to bridge the two: to automatically turn the conceptual relationships defined at the language level into a concrete visual representation. Rather than focusing on a fixed set of mathematical objects, we aim to make this framework user-extensible.},
