abstract = {The paper is concerned with the problem of approximating smooth curves in the plane by circular arc splines. The algorithm based on fitting a biarc to a segment of a given function or parametric curve of monotonic cur-vature is presented. The biarc formed of two tangentially joined circular arcs is constructed by assuming that it matches two end points and two tangents of the segment. However, such an interpolation problem imposes four conditions whereas the biarc has five degrees of freedom, and there exists a one parameter family of interpolating biarcs, which is searched iteratively by bisection method for finding a suitable one. If a given ac-curacy has not been achieved the segment is subdivided and this process is continued on smaller pieces. Finally, the fitting circular arc spline is obtained as the result of sequential applying the local biarc interpolation procedure.},
