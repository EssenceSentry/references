abstract = {Goal Programming (GP) can be regarded as one of the most widely used multicriteria decision-making techniques. In this paper, two surveys are carried out. First, the evolution of GP since its birth to the present time, in terms of number of publications, references, journals, etc., has been studied. Second, a more in-depth survey has been carried out, which covers the publications from year 2000 to the present time. All the references are listed, and some conclusions and future research lines have been extracted about the late trends of GP. Copyright copyright 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},
