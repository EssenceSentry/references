abstract = {Freeform surfaces, also called sculptured surfaces, have been widely used in various engineering applications. Freeform surfaces are primarily manufactured by CNC machining, especially 5-axis CNC machining. Various methodologies and computer tools have been developed in the past to improve efficiency and quality of freeform surface machining. This paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review on recent research development in CNC machining of freeform surfaces. This review primarily focuses on three aspects in freeform surface machining: tool path generation, tool orientation identification, and tool geometry selection. For each aspect, first concepts, requirements and fundamental research methods are briefly introduced. The major research methodologies developed in the past decade in each aspect are presented with details. Problems and future research directions are also discussed. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.
