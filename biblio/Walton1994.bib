abstract = {The paths of cutting tools used in a computer-aided manufacturing environment are usually described by means of circular arcs and straight line segments. In a computer aided design environment, however, objects are often designed using B-splines or B{\'{e}}zier curves. This paper develops a simple technique to find an arbitrarily close approximation to a quadratic B{\'{e}}zier curve by a G1curve consisting of circular arcs. {\textcopyright}1994.},
