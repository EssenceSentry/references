abstract = {Functions that map vectors with binary values into the inte- gers are important for the design and verification of arithmetic circuits. We demonstrate how multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs) can be used to represent such functions concisely. The Walsh transform and Reed-Muller transform have numerous applications in computer-aided design, but the usefulness of these techniques in practice has been limited by the size of the binary valued functions that can be transformed. We show how to compute the MTBDD representations of the Walsh transform and Reed-Muller transform for functions with several hundred variables. Bryant and Chen have proposed binary moment diagrams (BMDs) for rep- resenting the class of functions that we have considered. We discuss the relationship between these methods and describe a generalization called hybrid decision diagrams which is often much more concise.},
