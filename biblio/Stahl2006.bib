abstract = {This study describes the distribution of hobo-hybridizing sequences in the genus Drosophila. Southern blot analysis of 134 species revealed that hobo sequences are limited to the melanogaster and montium subgroups of the melanogaster-species group. Of the hobo-bearing species, only D. melanogaster and two of its sibling species, D. simulans and D. mauritiana, were found to contain potentially complete hobo elements. The distribution of hobo sequences is one of the narrowest distributions thus far described for any Drosophila transposable element.},
