abstract = {This paper presents a latent variable representation of regularized support vector machines (SVM's) that enables EM, ECME or MCMC algorithms to provide parameter estimates. We verify our representation by demonstrating that minimizing the SVM optimality criterion together with the parameter regularization penalty is equivalent to finding the mode of a mean-variance mixture of normals pseudo-posterior distribution. The latent variables in the mixture representation lead to EM and ECME point estimates of SVM parameters, as well as MCMC algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can bring Bayesian tools for Gaussian linear models to bear on SVM's. We show how to implement SVM's with spike-and-slab priors and run them against data from a standard spam filtering data set.},
