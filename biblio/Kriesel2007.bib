abstract = {Originally, this work has been prepared in the framework of a seminar of the University of Bonn in Germany, but it has been and will be extended (after being presented and published online under www.dkriesel.com on 5/27/2005). First and foremost, to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject of neural networks and, second, just to acquire more and more knowledge about LATEX. And who knows â€“ maybe one day this summary will become a real preface!},
