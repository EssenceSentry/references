abstract = {In the paper, we present a method for decomposing a discrete noisy curve into arcs and segments which are the frequent primitives in digital images. This method is based on two tools: dominant point detection using adaptive tangential cover and tangent space representation of the polygon issued from detected dominant points. The experiments demonstrate the robustness of the method w.r.t. noise.},
