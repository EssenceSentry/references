abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place con- ceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional lan- guages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy eval- uation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipu- late lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful pro- gramming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.},
