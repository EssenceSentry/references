abstract = {Geometry and in particular projective geometry (and its corresponding invariant theory) deals a lot with structural properties of geometric objects and their interrelations. This papers describes how concepts of tensor calculus can be used to express geometric invariants and how, in particular, diagrammatic notation can be used to deal with invariants in a highly intuitive way. In particular we explain how geometries like euclidean or spherical geometry can be dealt with in this framework. {\textcopyright}2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
