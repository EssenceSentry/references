abstract = {We show, in great detail, how the perturbative tools of quantum field theory allow one to rigorously obtain: a ``categorified'' Faa di Bruno type formula for multiple composition, an explicit formula for reversion and a proof of Lagrange-Good inversion, all in the setting of multivariable power series. We took great pains to offer a self-contained presentation that, we hope, will provide any mathematician who wishes, an easy access to the wonderland of quantum field theory.},
