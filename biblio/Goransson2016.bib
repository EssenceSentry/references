abstract = {Software Defined Networks: A Comprehensive Approach, Second Edition provides in-depth coverage of the technologies collectively known as Software Defined Networking (SDN). The book shows how to explain to business decision-makers the benefits and risks in shifting parts of a network to the SDN model, when to integrate SDN technologies in a network, and how to develop or acquire SDN applications. In addition, the book emphasizes the parts of the technology that encourage opening up the network, providing treatment for alternative approaches to SDN that expand the definition of SDN as networking vendors adopt traits of SDN to their existing solutions. Since the first edition was published, the SDN market has matured, and is being gradually integrated and morphed into something more compatible with mainstream networking vendors. This book reflects these changes, with coverage of the OpenDaylight controller and its support for multiple southbound protocols, the Inclusion of NETCONF in discussions on controllers and devices, expanded coverage of NFV, and updated coverage of the latest approved version (1.5.1) of the OpenFlow specification. - Contains expanded coverage of controllers - Includes a new chapter on NETCONF and SDN - Presents expanded coverage of SDN in optical networks - Provides support materials for use in computer networking courses},
